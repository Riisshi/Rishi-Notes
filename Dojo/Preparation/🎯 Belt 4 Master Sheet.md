## 🔗 Data Structures

- **Linked List**
    
    - Insert at beginning / end / position
        
    - Delete at beginning / end / position
        
    - Reverse a linked list (iterative + recursive)
        
- **Queue (Array-based, custom class)**
    
    - `enqueue(x)` → insert at rear
        
    - `dequeue()` → remove from front
        
    - `peek()` → front element without removing
        
    - Print elements by dequeuing (Challenge #13 style)
        
- **Stack**
    
    - Check for valid parentheses/brackets
        
    - Push, pop, peek implementation (array-based)

## 📊 Sorting

- Bubble Sort
    
- Insertion Sort
    
- Selection Sort
    
- Merge two sorted arrays

## 🔤 Strings

- Remove **first occurrence** of a substring
    
- Remove **last occurrence** of a substring
    
- Check if a string is a palindrome
    
- Check if two strings are anagrams
    
- Reverse words in a string

## 🔁 Recursion (Non-trivial)

- `pow(x, n)` (with **negative n** support)
    
- Reverse a string recursively
