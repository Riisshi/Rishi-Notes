# 📘 SWAYAM: Data Structures and Programming in Java – Lecture 1 Notes

---

## 🎯 Course Overview

### Purpose:

- To introduce **data**, its **structure**, and its role in **programming**.
- Emphasis on learning both **data structures** and **how to implement them using Java**.

### Goals:

- Understand different types of data and data structures.
- Learn how to **process data** using **algorithms** and **Java programs**.
- Bridge the gap between **data** and **meaningful information** using logic and code.

---

## 📊 What is Data?

### Definition:

- Data = raw facts (numbers, text, characters).
- Examples: Names, roll numbers, weights, email IDs, mobile numbers.

### Related Concept: **Entity**

- An entity represents a **real-world object**.
- Example: A student, employee, product, etc.

### Entity = Set of **Attributes**

- Each attribute represents a property of the entity:
    - Name → String
    - Age → Integer
    - Gender → Boolean or Char
    - Salary → Float
    - Employer → String

---

## 🔍 Data vs. Information

- **Data**: Raw values (e.g., 100, 250.5, etc.)
- **Information**: Extracted **meaning** from data through **processing**.

### Example:

Milk consumption data → Process → Get total cost or nutrition info.

---

## 🌐 Sources of Data

1. **Social Media**: Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Flickr.
2. **Scientific Instruments**: Satellites, labs, observatories.
3. **Mobile Devices**: Images, audio, SMS, app usage.
4. **IoT Devices**: Sensors, smart appliances, etc.

---

## 📦 Types and Volume of Data

- Data formats: Text, audio, video, images, numbers.
- Increasing exponentially — **Big Data**.

### Units of Data:

- Bytes → KB → MB → GB → TB → PB → EB → ZB → YB → _Quintillion Bytes_ (10^18)

---

## 💡 Why Data Structures?

- Needed to **organize** and **process** data efficiently.
- Helps handle **big data** in real time.
- Makes programming effective by defining how data is stored, accessed, and manipulated.

---

## 🧱 Primitive vs Abstract Data Types

### Primitive Data:

- Integer, Float, Boolean, Char — supported by all languages.

### Abstract Data:

- User-defined via **data abstraction** (Java: class, interface).
- Allows **custom design** for specific application needs (e.g., image handling).

---

## 🗂️ Types of Data Structures

### Basic Data Structures

#### Linear:

- **Array**
- **Linked List**
- **Stack**
- **Queue**

#### Non-Linear:

- **Tree**
- **Graph**
- **Table**
- **Set**

### Advanced Data Structures

- Built using basic structures.
- Example: Image processing using 2D arrays.

---

## 📚 Course Objective

- Learn **data structures + algorithms**.
- Implement them using **Java**.
- Write Java programs that:
    - Store and retrieve structured data
    - Use efficient algorithms to process data

---

## ☕ Java Programming Overview (Used in this Course)

### Java Programming Areas:

1. **Core Java**:
    - Basics, OOPs (Encapsulation, Inheritance)
    - Exception handling, Multithreading
2. **GUI Programming**:
    - AWT, Swing, JavaFX
3. **Distributed Programming**:
    - Networks, Internet, Mobile systems
4. **Database Programming**:

---

## 📦 Java Packages for Data Structures

1. `java.util`:
    - Core data structure classes (List, Set, Map, Queue)
2. `java.lang`:
    - Default package, includes `String` class
3. `java.io`:
    - Input/output, file handling, stream processing
