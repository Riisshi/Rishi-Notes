# ðŸ“˜ Introduction to Computer Architecture â€“ Lecture 1 Notes

**Course**: Computer Organization and Architecture  
**Based on**: McGraw-Hill, 2015 Edition

## ðŸ”· What is Computer Architecture?

- **Computer Architecture** refers to the structure and behavior of the computer system as seen by the programmer.
- It includes:
    - **Instruction set architecture (ISA)** â€“ set of instructions the CPU can execute.
    - **Hardware implementation** â€“ how the ISA is realized using logic gates and circuits.

### ðŸ“Œ Key Distinctions:

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Computer Architecture**|Logical structure and functional behavior visible to the programmer|
|**Computer Organization**|The physical implementation of the architecture (e.g., microarchitecture)|
|**Instruction Set Architecture**|Interface between hardware and software; defines instructions, registers, memory access etc.|
