## 🎯 **Why Study Operating Systems?**

- The **Operating System (OS)** is a **crucial software layer** in any computer.
- It **interfaces between**:
    - 🧱 **Computer hardware**
    - 🧠 **User-level applications**
- OS forms the **foundation of system functionality**.

---

## 🔍 **What Makes OS Different from Other Programs?**

1. 🧾 **OS is software**, but:
    - It is not like ordinary applications (e.g., Word, Browser).
2. ⚙️ **Low-level coding involved**:
    - Uses **Assembly language** in critical sections.
3. 🔌 **Interacts directly with hardware**:
    - Devices like **keyboard**, **network**, etc.
    - Regular user programs **do not interact directly** with hardware.
4. ⏱️ **Time-sensitive behavior**:
    - OS is **event-driven** (responds to hardware/software events).
    - Timing is critical for processes like:
        - Scheduling
        - Interrupt handling
        - Real-time control
5. 🪲 **Difficult to debug**:
    - Due to low-level, concurrent, and time-sensitive nature.
6. 🧠 **Hardware-specific**:
    - OS code is **closely tied to the processor architecture**.
    - Uses many **special CPU features**.

## 💡 **Course Perspective**

- Will use the **Intel x86 architecture** as the reference model.
- Most OS concepts taught are **general** and apply to **other processors** as well.
- Will explore:
    - OS **design intricacies**
    - **Performance trade-offs**
    - Real-world implementation considerations
