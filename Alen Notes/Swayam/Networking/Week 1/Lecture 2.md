# 🌐 Computer Networks – Lecture 2: Network Types & Applications

---

## 🎯 **Objectives of the Lecture**

- Understand four primary types of networks: **LAN, MAN, WAN, PAN**
- Differentiate between **Internet** and **Intranet**
- Learn how to **choose the right network type**
- Explore **real-world use cases** for each type

---

## 🔠 What Are Network Types?

**Network types** are classifications based on:

- **Geographical size**
- **Ownership & management**
- **Transmission speed**
- **Usage & purpose**

Understanding them helps:

- **Network architects** design appropriate systems
- **IT managers/business leaders** plan infrastructure
- **Users** select the right connectivity solutions

## 🏠 Local Area Network (LAN)

### 📌 Definition:

Connects devices within a **small area**: room, building, or small campus.

### ⚙️ Features:

- **High data transfer speeds**
- **Low latency**
- **Privately owned and managed**
- Cost-effective (Ethernet/Wi-Fi)

### 💡 Real-world Examples:

- **College lab**: Desktops connected to a local server
- **Corporate office**: Employees sharing files, drives, printers
- **Home Wi-Fi**: Phones, laptops, smart TVs connected

---

## 🏙️ Metropolitan Area Network (MAN)

### 📌 Definition:

Connects multiple LANs across a **city or large campus**.

### ⚙️ Features:

- Covers **wider area** than LAN, smaller than WAN
- Uses **fiber-optic** or high-speed backbone
- Supports moderate to high traffic
- Often managed by **service providers or institutions**

### 💡 Real-world Examples:

- **Citywide public Wi-Fi**
- **University networks**
- **Cable TV networks**
- **Municipal surveillance systems**

---

## 🌍 Wide Area Network (WAN)

### 📌 Definition:

Spans **countries or continents**, linking multiple LANs.

### ⚙️ Features:

- Uses routers, satellites, leased lines, undersea cables
- Slower than LANs due to long distances
- Enables **global communication**
- Typically **public or hybrid infrastructure**

### 💡 Real-world Examples:

- **The Internet** itself
- **Corporate global networks**
- **Cloud platforms** (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud)

---

## 👤 Personal Area Network (PAN)

### 📌 Definition:

Connects personal devices within a **few meters**.

### ⚙️ Features:

- **Short-range** wireless: Bluetooth, Infrared, Wi-Fi Direct
- Focused on **convenience and mobility**
- No central router needed

### 💡 Real-world Examples:

- **Bluetooth headphones connected to phone**
- **AirDrop or Wi-Fi direct file transfer**
- **Smartwatch syncing with phone**
- **Tablet printing wirelessly**

## 🔁 Comparison Table

|Feature|LAN|MAN|WAN|PAN|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Coverage**|Small (room/building)|Medium (city/campus)|Very Large (global)|Very Small (personal)|
|**Speed**|High|Moderate to High|Moderate|Varies|
|**Ownership**|Private|Institutional/ISP|ISP/Government|Individual|
|**Use Case**|Homes, Offices|Universities, Cities|Internet, Corporates|Personal Devices|

---

## 🌐 The Internet – Global Connectivity

### 📌 Definition:

- World's **largest WAN**, connecting billions of devices globally
- Based on **TCP/IP** protocol suite

### ⚙️ Applications:

- Access to websites, email, social media, cloud services

### 🔐 Risks:

- Prone to **cyberattacks and data breaches**
- Protected by: **HTTPS**, **VPNs**, **firewalls**

---

## 🛡️ Intranet – Secure Internal Network

### 📌 Definition:

- A **private network** within an organization
- Uses Internet tech (browsers, TCP/IP) but **restricted access**

### ⚙️ Uses:

- Internal communication
- Document and HR systems
- Collaboration without external exposure

---

## 🌐 Internet vs Intranet: Key Differences

|Feature|Internet|Intranet|
|---|---|---|
|**Access**|Public, open to all|Private, organization-specific|
|**Security**|Vulnerable to external threats|Protected behind firewalls|
|**Scope**|Global and decentralized|Local and centrally managed|
|**Purpose**|Universal communication|Internal resource sharing|

---

## 🧠 Choosing the Right Network Type

Ask the following questions:

1. **Scope**: Room, city, country, or globe?
2. **Users**: Few individuals or thousands?
3. **Speed**: Is high-speed crucial?
4. **Security**: Is the data sensitive?
5. **Budget**: How much can you spend on setup and maintenance?

### 🧩 Optimal Match:

- **PAN**: For wearables, phone syncing
- **LAN**: For home, school, small offices
- **MAN**: For university campuses, city services
- **WAN**: For global businesses, cloud computing

---

## ✅ Summary

- **LAN**: High-speed, local, cost-effective
- **MAN**: City-wide, links multiple LANs
- **WAN**: Covers countries/continents; backbone of the internet
- **PAN**: For personal device networking
- **Internet**: Public global WAN
- **Intranet**: Secure, internal, organizational use
- Choosing the right type depends on **scale, users, speed, security, and cost**
