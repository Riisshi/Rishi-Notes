# 🛡️ Ethical Hacking – Lecture 1 Notes

### 📘 Title: Introduction to Ethical Hacking

---

## 1. ✅ What is Ethical Hacking?

- **Ethical Hacking**:  
    Legally identifying weaknesses and vulnerabilities in computer systems, networks, or infrastructure.
- **Key Purpose**:  
    To protect against potential attacks by finding the weak points **before** malicious hackers do.
- **Method**:  
    Mimicking the **intent and actions of malicious hackers**, but with **legal permission** and **good intentions**.

## 2. 🔁 Related Terminologies

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Penetration Testing**|Attempt to break into a system/network to find vulnerabilities.|
|**Intrusion Testing**|Synonym for penetration testing.|
|**Red Teaming**|Simulating real-world attacks to test system defense mechanisms.|

---

## 3. 🧑‍💻 Role of an Ethical Hacker

- **Legally hired** by organizations to test their systems.
- Acts like a **malicious hacker** to expose vulnerabilities.
- Prepares a **detailed report** of findings (vulnerabilities).
- May provide **solutions**, often for an additional fee.
- **Does not** carry out real damage or misuse data.

---

## 4. 🧾 Difference Between Ethical & Malicious Hacking

|Ethical Hacker|Malicious Hacker|
|---|---|
|Has **permission** from the organization.|Works without permission.|
|Intent is to **help protect** the system.|Intent is to **damage or steal data**.|
|Submits reports for fixing vulnerabilities.|Exploits vulnerabilities for personal gain.|

---

## 5. ⚙️ Common Terminologies in Hacking

|Term|Meaning|
|---|---|
|**Hacking**|Use of technical expertise to break into systems.|
|**Cracking**|Breaking into software/hardware security.|
|**Spoofing**|Falsifying identity to gain unauthorized access.|
|**DoS Attack**|Overloading a server with fake traffic to slow/stop services.|
|**Port Scanning**|Identifying open ports to find vulnerable entry points.|

---

## 6. 🔓 Ways to Gain Access to a System

|Method|Explanation|
|---|---|
|**Front Door**|Guessing or stealing passwords. Most common method.|
|**Back Door**|Hidden entries left by developers (for diagnostics or malicious use).|
|**Trojan Horse**|Malicious code hidden inside trusted software. Can exist in hardware too.|
|**Software Vulnerabilities**|Using known software flaws that users haven't patched yet.|

---

## 7. 📂 Actions After Gaining Access

- Erase or modify **logs** to hide tracks.
- **Steal, modify, or destroy** files.
- **Deface websites** or public data.
- Install **backdoors** for future access.
- Use compromised system to attack **other systems** in the network.

## 8. 🧒 Types of Hackers

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|**Script Kiddies**|Beginners copying known hacks.|
|**Experienced Testers**|Create own tools/scripts using Python, Perl, C, etc.|

---

## 9. 💻 Tools Used – "Tiger Box"

- A portable system with:
    - Multiple OSs
    - Penetration tools
- Used for:
    - **Vulnerability assessments**
    - **Simulated attacks**

---

## 10. ⚖️ Testing Approaches

|Approach|Description|
|---|---|
|**White Box**|Full access to system details (diagrams, interviews, etc.). Easier for tester.|
|**Black Box**|No system info provided. Tester must find everything.|
|**Gray Box**|Partial system info available. Most practical approach.|

---

## 11. ⚖️ Legal & Ethical Considerations

- **Laws vary by country**.
- Stay aware of what’s **legally allowed** in your country or workplace.
- **Some tools may be illegal** in certain regions.
- **Cybercrime punishments** are getting stricter.


**Illegal Actions (even during testing)**:

- Accessing systems **without permission**.
- Installing **viruses/worms**.
- Performing **DoS attacks**.
- Denying **user access** to resources.

---

## 12. 🎯 Skills Required for Ethical Hackers

- Strong knowledge of **Computer Networks & Technology**.
- Understanding of **Cryptography** (for fixing vulnerabilities).
- Good **communication skills**.
- Familiarity with **security tools** (open-source, commercial, or custom).

---

## 13. 🧠 Topics Covered in This Course

1. **Network Technologies** (fundamentals of computer networks)
2. **Cryptography Basics** (important for securing systems)
3. **Case Studies** of secure applications
4. **Unconventional/Hardware-Based Attacks**
5. **Practical Demonstrations** of penetration testing & tools
