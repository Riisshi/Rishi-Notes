# 🧠 Course Introduction: C Programming and Assembly Language

---

## 🎯 Motivation for the Course

- Many students learn **C programming** and **assembly language** **separately**, but there’s a **missing bridge** between the two.
- Students often **don’t understand**:
    - How a C program **executes** on a microprocessor.
    - What physically happens in **memory segments** (stack, heap, etc.).
- Common misconceptions:
    - Students say local variables are on the stack—but don't **understand what that means** physically.
    - They use terms like **local scope/global scope** without connecting them to memory operations.

## 🎓 Course Objectives

The course aims to **physically demonstrate** how C code gets executed on a microprocessor using:

- **Simple examples**
- **Animations**
- **Inline assembly programming**

---

## ✅ Learning Outcomes

After completing the course, you will be able to:

1. 🔍 Explain how **function calls** are translated to assembly.
2. 📦 Explain how **parameters are passed** to functions.
3. 🧠 Understand what it means to say **local variables are stored on the stack**.
4. 🛠️ Demonstrate how **local variable space is allocated** by the compiler.
5. 🧼 Explain how local variables **go out of scope** after a function exits.
6. 🧾 List assembly instructions that execute **before entering** and **after exiting** a function (prologue/epilogue).
7. 🔄 Understand **C calling conventions**, especially:
    - Fixed argument list
    - Variable argument list
8. 🆚 Compare **C and C++** at the assembly level.
9. 🚀 Use **hardware-level instructions** to **optimize C functions**.
10. ⚠️ Explain **why recursion** may be inefficient in assembly-level execution.

## 🖥️ Microprocessor System Overview

### 📦 Microprocessor = "Black Box" for Computation

Connected to:
- **RAM** (Random Access Memory)
- Communicates via:
    - **Data Bus** (bidirectional)
    - **Address Bus** (unidirectional)
    - **Control Signals**: `RD` (read), `WR` (write)

### 📊 Logical Memory Map

- **Address Bus** = N bits → Can address `2^N` locations.
- **Each location** = K bits (commonly 8 bits per byte).

```
Logical Map: 
+----------------+    Address 0 (8 bits) 
+----------------+    Address 1 (8 bits) 
...
+----------------+    Address 2^N - 1 (8 bits)
```

- Logical addressing separates the **programmer's view** from the **physical memory layout**.

### 💡 Example

Even if **physically** each location is 16 or 32 bits wide, **logically** the memory is viewed as a sequence of **8-bit bytes**.
